# 2048 Game

This is a web-based version of the popular puzzle game 2048 implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Overview

2048 is a single-player sliding block puzzle game where the player combines tiles with numbers to achieve the elusive tile with a value of 2048. The game is played on a 4x4 grid, where tiles can be moved in four directions (up, down, left, right), and new tiles with values of either 2 or 4 appear after each move.

## How to Play

- Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) or the 'W', 'A', 'S', 'D' keys on your keyboard to move the tiles in the corresponding direction.
- Tiles with the same value will merge when they collide, doubling their value.
- The objective is to create a tile with a value of 2048. The game ends when the player achieves this goal or when there are no more valid moves left.

## Features

- Responsive design: Playable on desktop and mobile devices.
- Score tracking: Keep track of your score as you play.
- Game over detection: Alert message when the game is over.
- Color-coded tiles: Each tile value is represented by a different color for easy identification.
